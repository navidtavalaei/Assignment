Design & Development by Navid Tavalaei

Front-end development in HTML, CSS (and Javascript) | The main objective of this project is to implement my learnings in HTML, CSS, JS. I created a webpage for BTS students to find out how many days are left to the graduation 2019-2020. I have included the following features/changes to practice some of my learnings in this class:

Creating full page parallax scroll effect,
adding a page with a countdown,
adding 2 background images,
changing style & size of fonts,
removing some elements from the original source,
Here is a screenshot of the original source:
